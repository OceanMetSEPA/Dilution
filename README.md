# Dilution
Description of Initial Dilution and Secondary Mixing used in SEPA's near-field assessments of point discharges.

## Initial Dilution
This is the dilution that a buoyant plume undergoes between leaving the outfall and reaching the water surface. 

## Secondary Dilution
This is the dilution that occurs between the surface boil of the plume and the edge of the mixing zone. It can be estimated using the Brooks model.
